# Agent instructions

## Handbook — check this first

Conventions and cross-project decisions live in `.handbook/`, a local symlink to the
`agent-handbook` repository. **They are mandatory, and they override your defaults.**

If `.handbook/` is missing, empty, or unreadable: **stop and say so.** Tell the user to run
`agent-handbook/scripts/link.sh` against this repository. Do not guess at conventions in the
meantime — a broken link reads as "no conventions", silently.

## Always

These apply to every task.

- **Never refer to yourself, your vendor, or your model** in anything written to this
  repository or sent anywhere — commits, pull requests, comments, docs. No `Co-Authored-By:`
  trailer, no "generated with", no tool names. Several tools add these by default; override the
  default. A required check fails the pull request if you don't.
- **Do not commit, push, open a pull request, or merge unless explicitly asked.** Leave changes
  in the working tree and say what you changed. Approval for one is not approval for the next.
- **Never write through `.handbook/`.** It's a different repository — read it, never write it.
- **Never force-push, amend a pushed commit, or skip a hook or check** (`--no-verify`). Fix the
  underlying problem.
- **Never disable, weaken, or skip a failing lint rule, type check, or test.** Fix what it
  caught, or say the check itself is wrong and ask.
- **Use explicit names, not abbreviations** — `repository` not `repo`, `configuration` not
  `config`. Terms of art (`API`, `URL`, `ID`) and tool-dictated filenames are exempt.

## Read these when the task calls for it

Don't load them upfront; read the one that applies.

`.handbook/conventions/background/` is rationale, not instructions. Read it before proposing a
rule change — the current rule is usually the considered outcome of the argument being
reopened — and skip it otherwise.

## This repository

`vscode-theme-rhodonite`, Itrium's Rhodonite palette as a color theme for Visual Studio Code and
the editors built on it: **Rhodonite** (dark) and **Rhodonite Light**. No code runs in the
editor; the extension is two JSON theme files, generated.

- **`themes/` is generated; `source/` is the truth.** `source/colors.mjs` reads the interface
  colors from `@itrium/palettes` and holds the syntax and terminal colors, `source/theme.mjs`
  decides where each color goes, `scripts/build.mjs` writes the files. The generated files are
  committed because the editor reads them as they are; a test fails when they're stale.
- **Every color passes level AA** (`.handbook/conventions/reference/brand.md`): `source/check.mjs`
  pairs every text color with every surface it sits on, plus the cursor, focus outlines and
  active lines at 3:1. Never weaken a threshold or drop a pairing to make a color pass; change
  the color. A new interface color with text on it gets a pairing.
- **The checker has to fail what it should.** `tests/contrast.test.mjs` feeds it broken themes;
  a change to the checker keeps those tests failing the broken input.
- **The syntax and terminal colors match the Rhodonite terminal themes** (Ghostty and the shell
  prompt), so code reads the same in the editor and a shell. Change them together.
- **Pink means focus, the active item and the primary action.** Don't add it as decoration;
  light mode never uses pastel pink as text or as a line.

### Commands

| What | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install | `pnpm install` |
| Write `themes/` from `source/` | `pnpm build` |
| Check the committed themes | `pnpm test` |
| Check, then package `dist/*.vsix` | `pnpm package` |

Before calling a change done, run `pnpm build`, then `pnpm package` (which runs the tests), and
look at it installed in the editor, dark and light.
